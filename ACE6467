This challenge is based on Cicada 3301 theme.

First install the image and you need to use exiftool to find its dimensions and after that multiply its length, breadth and add the 6467 which will result in 2529797 and this is the password to command :  steghide extract -sf Start.jpg


Now on to second step we get a message.txt with content:
 
Jvunyhabshapvuz fvb bujvclylk aol alea, uvd mvssvd aopz spur mvy fvby ulea zalw vm aol wbggsl.
oaawz://kypcl.nvvnsl.jvt/mpsl/k/1HMWOhQ0dGTGDFKrB-RepDb9g5hATz6LV/cpld?bzw=zohypun


Its ROT-7 encrypted after decoding it we get:
Congratulations you uncovered the text, now follow this link for your next step of the puzzle.

Which is a rickroll image and we also need to perform the steghide extract -sf RickRoll.jpg command on this one and the password is its length and breadth without multiplying which is: 259x194

Now step 3: We get another message with encrypted text as:

Which was decoded to :
You have successfully uncovered this message. Congratulations, but if you think that was the end then you might be very wrong.

USING VINGERE DECODING using "HAHAKEEPTRYING" as keyword.

Step 4: After downloading the Book from Github we just have to search for "ACECTF" and it shows a sentence ACECTF “The” “B00K” and “Of S3cr3ts.”

Now just create a flag out of this and try submitting it in the end we got

ACECTF{7h3_b00k_0f_53cr375}
